### Introduction

This project involved the wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing of datasets associated with the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). From the documentation given, WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10 with over 4 million followers and ample international media coverage. The datasets used in this project was gathered from various sources, assessed, cleaned, and insights was drawn from them.
On the overall, it was concluded more processes need to be carried out to bring definitive insights out of the available data.
Insights were then drawn from the cleaned data which coupled with some drawn up visualizations showed some pretty interesting details. However, it should be noted that the datasets in uestion still had some issues to be corrected, which coupled with appropriate domain knowledge should result in even more impressive and accurate insights.
